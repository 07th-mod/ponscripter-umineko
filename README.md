# ponscripter-umineko

This repository hosts executables which are the same as in the https://github.com/07th-mod/ponscripter-fork/ repository, but we use `resourcehacker` to change the icon for Umineko. 

For MacOS, some extra files are also included from https://github.com/07th-mod/ponscripter-umineko/releases/download/v0.0.0/umineko-mac-exe-base.zip.

## Build instructions

Ensure the release is fully released at https://github.com/07th-mod/ponscripter-fork/ . Then push a new tag to this repository.
